      <description>Introduction This is an introductory article on botnets. I intend to just &amp;lsquo;skim&amp;rsquo; over the topic: explain what botnets are, how they work, the different attacks that they can carry out and prevention and detection methods. My purpose is that the reader becomes aware about botnets. The subtopics being vast in themselves, cannot be covered here and deserve an article of their own.
Pre-requisites  A basic understanding of how devices communicate in client-server and peer-to-peer forms of communication.</description>
