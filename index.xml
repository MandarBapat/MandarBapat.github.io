      <description>Why Kronos? To be honest, I too don&amp;rsquo;t have the answer.I was in the lobby of a multiplayer computer game and had to choose a name for my character. &amp;lsquo;Kronos&amp;rsquo; popped up in my head and since then it has stuck around. I decided to extend it to my blog website and give it a symbol. And there you have it!!!
I am a junior undergraduate in the Computer Science department at IIT Kanpur.</description>
